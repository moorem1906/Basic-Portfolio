      <p class="thick" class=font-family: Caveat, cursive>You must die to predisposition inorder to become who you're
          designed to be.</p>

      <p class="c" class=font-family: Caveat, cursive> During my time at George Washington University's coding Bootcamp,
        I've gained invaluable career-advancing skills. As a full-stack web developer, I've acquired technological
        expertise in both front-end and back-end application development. As a result, I gained familiarity with
        each layer of a 3-tier model. The 3-tier consists of
        The presentation layer ( Main front end portion which deals with the user interface),
        Business Logic Layer (back-end portion of any application which deals with data validation)
        Database Layer
        Skill sets required as a Full Stack Developer

        <p> 1) Front-end technology
          As a Full-stack developer, I've learned the essential front-end technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.
          Knowledge of third-party libraries like jQuery, Angular and React Js.

          <p> 2) Development Languages
            As a Full-stack developer, I've learned at least one server-side programming language like Java. </p>

          <p> 3) Database and cache
            Knowledge of various DBMS technology is another important skill acquired as I full stack developer. MySQL,
            MongoDB, and SQLServer are widely used for this purpose. </p>

          <p> 4) Basic design ability
            I have gained skills in the basic prototype design and UI /UX design. </p>

          <p> 5) Version control system (VCS)
            As a full-stack developer, I have gained knowledge of Git, which helps to understand how to get the latest
            code, update parts of the code, make changes in other developer's code without breaking things. </p>
